## Lessons Learned
This was my first time working with TailwindCSS. I experienced a longer time styling the project as I am not yet familiar with the classes. However, I really enjoyed the utility first approach, making it easier to modify. I thoroughly enjoyed the mobile-design first. Up to this point, I had always built my projects for desktops first, but the responsive design features TailwindCSS provides makes it a seamless experience to create websites that look great on all devices and eliminates the need for complex media queries. Looking forward to creating more projects with this CSS framework!
